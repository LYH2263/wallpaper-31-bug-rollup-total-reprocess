"""Multi-wall order batch aggregation.

Pure summarisation: every wall is calculated independently with the same
single-wall engine (``app.engines.wallpaper_math.roll_count``); this module
only fans the calculation out and sums the per-wall results. It never reaches
into the database or HTTP layer, and it deliberately does not merge walls
before calculating (each wall keeps its own drops/rolls).
Saved runs are reopened exactly as stored: totals.rolls always equals the
plain sum of the per-wall rolls, with no secondary processing on open.
